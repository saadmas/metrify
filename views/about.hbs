                Your top played Spotify tracks and artists are gathered directly through Spotify. 
                They are based on a measure known as <strong>affinity</strong>.

                According to Spotify, <strong>affinity</strong> is a measure of the expected preference a user has for a particular track or artist.  
                It is based on user behavior, including play history, but does not include actions made while in incognito mode. 
                Note that light or infrequent users of Spotify may not have sufficient play history to generate a full affinity data set.
